                  I call most of my poetry shower thoughts poetry
                  because for most of them, their biggest punchlines came 
                  to me during those intimate, quite moments of self-care
                  where my mind felt safe to wander. They deliver the punch because
                  they are as raw and naked as I was in the moments they can to be, 
                  it is said that the poem you are most afraid to write is the one 
                  you should definitely write. I think sometimes some peices just
                  ooze out of you, even when you are not ready to deliver them because
                  they are ready to be told.
